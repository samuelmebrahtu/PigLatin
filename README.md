# PigLatin
Java program to convert a string into Pig Latin.
 Rules (source https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~morelanj/RAO/prepare2.html):
 
 Most words in Pig Latin end in "ay." Use the rules below to translate normal English into Pig Latin.

1. If a word starts with a consonant and a vowel, put the first letter of the word at the end of the word and add "ay."

Example: Happy = appyh + ay = appyhay


2. If a word starts with two consonants move the two consonants to the end of the word and add "ay."

Example: Child = Ildch + ay = Ildchay


3. If a word starts with a vowel add the word "way" at the end of the word.

Example: Awesome = Awesome +way = Awesomeway


Putting It All Together
The sentence "Pig Latin is hard to speak." is written below in Pig Latin:

Igpay Atinlay isway ardhay otay eakspay.

Notice how "Igpay" is actually "Pig." Because the first character of pig is moved to the end, with "ay" added to the end, it makes Pig Latin very hard to read.
